# Data-preprocessing-for-bank-s-loan-department
The project's goal is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division and find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. The report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.


# Steps to accomplish the project

- Identify and fill in missing values
- Replace the real number data type with the integer type
- Delete duplicate data
- Categorize the data

# We'll explain:

- Which missing values were identified
- Possible reasons these missing values were present
- Which method was used to fill in missing values
- Which method was used to find and delete duplicate data and why
- Possible reasons why duplicate data was present
- Which method was used to change the data type and why
- Which dictionaries were selected for this dataset and why

# We'll answer the following questions:

- Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
- How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?
